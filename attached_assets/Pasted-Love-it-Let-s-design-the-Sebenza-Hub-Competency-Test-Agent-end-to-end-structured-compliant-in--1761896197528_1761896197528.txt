Love it. Let’s design the **Sebenza Hub Competency Test Agent** end-to-end—structured, compliant in South Africa, and inspired by best-in-class players like TestGorilla—while keeping full recruiter control.

# What the Agent Does (at a glance)

* **Inputs:** Job title, job description, key responsibilities (+ optional company values, seniority, industry, languages).
* **Outputs:** A complete, standards-aligned assessment pack:

  * **Skills Test** (work samples, SJTs, domain MCQs, caselets)
  * **Aptitude Test** (numerical, verbal, logical)
  * **Work-style / Personality indicators** (non-clinical work preferences; see SA compliance notes below)
  * **Recruiter custom questions** (all formats)
  * **Timing, difficulty, scoring rubrics, pass thresholds, anti-cheating settings**
  * **Localized** to SA context, idioms, and labor norms.

---

## Guardrails & Compliance (South Africa + global standards)

* **Legal & ethical baseline:**

  * **POPIA:** clear purpose specification, minimality, consent/notice, retention, data subject rights, info officer, and penalties for non-compliance. Build in privacy notices, retention windows, and DSR flows. ([Government of South Africa][1])
  * **Employment Equity Act & HPCSA landscape:** Psychological tests must be valid, reliable, fair, and not biased. While HPCSA “certification” requirements have shifted over time, tests measuring psychological constructs remain regulated; classification by HPCSA and use by registered practitioners still apply. Treat anything “psychological” with caution or partner with registered practitioners for those modules. ([psyssa.com][2])
  * **ISO 10667** (assessment service delivery) as your process backbone: documented rationale, transparent procedures, quality, fairness, and stakeholder roles (client vs. service provider). ([ISO][3])
* **Science base:** Use **SJTs** and **work samples** to predict performance (strong validity across roles). ([researchgate.net][4])
* **Anti-cheating:** Adopt industry features (randomization, IP/full-screen monitoring, webcam snapshots with consent, proctoring flags)—and communicate that flags are indicative, not determinative. ([testgorilla.com][5])

## Recruiter Experience

**Creation flow (2 minutes):**

1. Paste **Job Title, JD, Key Responsibilities** → Agent drafts a **Test Blueprint** (skills/aptitude/SJT mix, time, difficulty curve).
2. Choose **Test Types** (toggle on/off), **length**, **cut scores**, **anti-cheat**.
3. Add **Custom Questions** (MCQ, free text, file/video upload, coding task, spreadsheet task, case study, SJT scenario, roleplay prompt).
4. Pick **Languages** (EN + optional isiZulu/isiXhosa/Afrikaans) and **delivery channel** (web, mobile, **WhatsApp-first** link).
5. **Preview** → **Publish** → Link auto-embeds in the job post + can be sent via WhatsApp/SMS/email.

**Question formats supported**

* MCQ/Multiple-select, ranking/ordering, true/false
* **SJT** (scenario + options; best/worst; or rank), **work samples** (mini projects), **short answers**, **code**, **data tasks**, **video** (structured prompts), **file upload** (e.g., Excel model)
* Timed sections, per-item timers, and **adaptive** difficulty (optional)

**Customization**

* Bank and re-use your own items
* Tag questions to **competencies** (e.g., Customer empathy, Hazard awareness, IFRS basics, SHEQ, POPIA literacy)
* Weight sections (e.g., Skills 60%, Aptitude 25%, Work-style 15%)
* Role-level blueprints (Intern → Senior → Manager)

---

## Candidate Experience

* **Friction-light:** Deep-link via WhatsApp, mobile-friendly UI, low data mode
* **Transparency:** upfront privacy notice & purpose; expected time; accessibility options
* **Cheating deterrence:** clear, consent-based proctoring + environment checks (no blanket rejection on flags) ([support.testgorilla.com][6])
* **Localization:** SA-relevant scenarios (e.g., POPIA basics, EEA basics, VAT basics, local customer scenarios, load-shedding contingencies)

---

## Scoring & Decisioning

* **Per-competency scoring** + section scores + **overall fit score**
* **Norms & Benchmarks:** start with internal norms by job family, then build SA market norms as data accrues (industry & seniority stratified; update quarterly)
* **Reliability/validity dashboards:** item difficulty & discrimination, DIF checks for fairness, adverse impact monitoring (4/5ths heuristic + local guidance)
* **Cut-score engine:** set thresholds by **role criticality** and hiring volume; simulate pass rates
* **Reports:** recruiter summary, candidate feedback summary, audit trail (ISO 10667 style) ([ISO][3])

---

## Anti-Cheating Stack (configurable)

* Question/answer **randomization**, **large item pools**, timeboxing
* **IP / device / full-screen** events, **copy/paste** detection, **keystroke anomalies**
* **Webcam snapshots** (opt-in; with consent wording aligned to POPIA), location variance flags with guidance not to use flags alone for rejection. ([testgorilla.com][7])

---

## South Africa–specific stance on “Personality Tests”

* Offer **work-style indicators** (e.g., Big-Five–style preferences) only as **non-diagnostic**, **advisory** signals; avoid clinical labels. For any instrument claiming psychological constructs, **partner with HPCSA-registered practitioners** and use **classified** tools; otherwise keep within non-psychological work styles and observable behavior prompts. ([psyssa.com][2])

---

## Test Libraries (seed ideas)

* **Skills:** MS Excel (intermediate, SA VAT calcs), SQL basics, Customer Service (SA retail scenarios), Driver safety checks, Basic SHEQ, Bookkeeping (VAT, UIF), POPIA literacy, Front-desk etiquette, Collections calling, Cold-calling roleplay
* **Aptitude:** Numeric reasoning (tables/ratios), Verbal reasoning (work memos), Logical reasoning (patterns)
* **Work-style:** Team vs. solo preference, ambiguity tolerance, conscientiousness proxies, customer orientation (non-diagnostic)

---

## Example: Test Blueprint (Customer Service Agent – Retail)

**Duration:** 35–45 min
**Weights:** Skills 55% | Aptitude 30% | Work-style 15%

1. **Skills (work sample + SJT) – 25 min**

   * SJT: “Customer returns without receipt during load-shedding” (rank best→worst responses)
   * Email rewrite for clarity (free text rubric)
   * Policy snippet comprehension (POP & returns) – 6 MCQs
2. **Aptitude – 12 min**

   * 8 numeric (discounts, VAT, stock variance)
   * 6 verbal (policy inference)
3. **Work-style – 8 min**

   * 12 Likert items (service mindset, stress handling) → advisory only

**Anti-cheat:** item shuffling, per-scenario variants, full-screen monitor
**Cut-score:** 70 overall, with Skills ≥ 60

(Design draws on evidence for **SJT/work-sample validity** and a defensible process per **ISO 10667**; include consent & POPIA notices.) ([researchgate.net][4])

## Data Model (simplified)

* **Assessment** { id, role, job_family, duration, weights, anti_cheat_cfg, languages[] }
* **Section** { id, type: skills|aptitude|workstyle, weight, time_limit }
* **Item** { id, format, stem, options[], key, rubric, tags[competency], locale, difficulty, discrimination }
* **Attempt** { candidate_id, device_meta, consent_flags, proctoring_events[], start/end }
* **Scores** { item_scores[], section_scores, overall, flags[] }
* **Audit** { blueprint_json, version, reviewer, validity_notes }

## Agent Prompts & Schemas

**Assessment Blueprint (LLM) – System Prompt (abridged)**
“Given job title, JD, and responsibilities, produce a JSON blueprint for a legally and ethically defensible pre-hire assessment aligned to ISO-10667 process quality. Include SA-relevant scenarios. Output sections (skills/aptitude/work-style), item mix, time, difficulty curve, scoring weights, cut-score rationale, anti-cheat settings, and candidate instructions. Avoid clinical/diagnostic personality claims; keep work-style advisory. Ensure POPIA-compliant consent text placeholders.”

**Blueprint JSON (schema sketch)**

```json
{
  "meta": { "job_title": "", "job_family": "", "languages": ["en-ZA"], "duration_min": 40 },

    { "type":"skills", "time":25, "items":[ /* item blueprints */ ] },
    { "type":"aptitude", "time":12, "items":[ /* … */ ] },
    { "type":"work_style", "time":8, "items":[ /* … */ ] }
  ],
  "candidate_notice": { "privacy":"{{POPIA_NOTICE}}", "accommodations":true }
}
```

**Item JSON (examples)**

* **SJT**

```json
{ "format":"sjt_rank", "stem":"A customer…", "options":[ "...", "...", "...", "..." ], "key":"RANK: 3>1>4>2", "competencies":["Customer Empathy","Policy Adherence"], "difficulty":"M" }
```

* **MCQ**

```json
{ "format":"mcq", "stem":"A product sells for R799 including 15% VAT. Excl. VAT price?", "options":["R679.15","R695.65","R700.00","R739.00"], "key":"R695.65", "competencies":["Numeracy","VAT"] }
```

* **Work-style (advisory)**

```json
{ "format":"likert", "stem":"I stay calm with multiple customers waiting.", "scale":5, "reverse":false, "construct":"stress_tolerance_advisory" }
```

**Recruiter Custom Item** (free-form authoring UI → validated to schema)

## Tech & Delivery

* **Generation:** LLM-based blueprinting + item drafting; human-in-the-loop editor; item bank with A/B variants.
* **Scoring:** Auto for objective items; **rubric scoring** + optional AI-assist for free text/video (with human override).
* **Proctoring:** Front-end events + server-side heuristics; candidate-friendly guidance (flags ≠ automatic fail, per TestGorilla stance). ([support.testgorilla.com][6])
* **Accessibility:** extra time flag, dyslexia-friendly font mode, alt-text, keyboard-only.
* **Internationalization:** South African English by default, optional translations next.

## MVP → v1 Rollout

1. **MVP (4–6 weeks):** Skills + Aptitude, SA-flavored scenarios, recruiter custom items, anti-cheat basics, POPIA notices, reports.
2. **v1:** Work-style advisory module (non-diagnostic), adaptive sections, norms dashboard, WhatsApp deep links, multi-language packs.
3. **v1.1:** Practitioner-only psychometric add-ons via partner (for roles that need them), ISO-10667 audit trail exports.

---

## What we’re borrowing from leaders

* **Rapid test assembly, big test library, anti-cheat, AI-assisted scoring, and candidate-first UX** (inspired by TestGorilla). We follow their caution that proctoring flags are signals—not verdicts. ([testgorilla.com][5])

## Quick win: want a live example?

Tell me **one role** you’re hiring for (e.g., “Warehouse Supervisor” or “Junior Bookkeeper”), and I’ll produce:

* A **ready-to-launch blueprint** (JSON)
* **10 sample items** (skills/SJT/aptitude/work-style)
* **Recruiter add-on slots**
* Recommended **cut-scores** and **report** template

We’ll make sure the wording, notices, and process fit **POPIA**, **Employment Equity Act/HPCSA constraints**, and **ISO 10667** good practice from day one. ([Government of South Africa][1])

If you prefer, we can start with “**Customer Service Agent (Retail)**” or “**Junior Bookkeeper (SME)**” and I’ll generate the full pack now.
